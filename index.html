  <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
      new
      son
      and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
      far
      beyond the world of known physics.</p>
  <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
      created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
      with.
      A
      potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with
      a
      special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
      speed
      of
      light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
  <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
      to
      pole
      and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
      irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
      spit
      in
      the ocean.</p>
  <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
      it.
  </p>
  <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
      beginning
      of
      the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

      <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years <a href="#" class="paragraph-link">to the first
              sliver of
              cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South
          Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics
          detected
          ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#"
              class="paragraph-link">gravitational
              waves</a> — the signature of a universe being
          wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
          a
          second old.
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
          colleagues say,
          that
          Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
      <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
          wondered
          whether it could ever be proved.</p>
      <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the
          recent
          discovery of
          dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms
          of time
          and
          space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
      <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
          space
          with
          its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos
          whose
          extent,
          architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
          endless
          number
          of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
      </p>
      <h4>‘As Big as It Gets’</h4>
      <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
          beyond
          the
          reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s
          ripples
          would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s
          theory
          of
          general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
      <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of
          the team,
          said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded
          in
          gravitational waves.”</p>
      <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
          that
          permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as
          hot as
          the
          surface of the sun.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background
          Imaging of
          Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
          Center for
          Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

  <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
  <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
      confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
  <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
  <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and
      analysis.
      Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
      select
      few,
      meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is
      his
      son,
      Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
  <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who
      chose
      his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
  <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
      inflation,
      known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
      Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a

  <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
  <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not
      think
      that
      we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
      wrote in
      an email.</p>
  <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
      “Having
      news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
  <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
      spread,
      astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
  <p> Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
      will
      go
      down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
  <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
      project
      called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
      beautiful
      and very convincing,” he said.</p>

  <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a
      pair
      of
      universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
      model,
      but he
      expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
  <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
      that
      the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by
      the
      European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
  <p>So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.“</p>
  <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings
      this
      year.
      At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
      space.

  <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which
      were
      discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won
      the
      Nobel
      Prize.</p>
  <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
      leaders
      of
      Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
      where
      the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the
      University
      of
      Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
  <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said.
      He
      has
      been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

  <p> In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
      meaning
      the
      light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
  <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation.
      Such
      waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist
      the
      direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
      polarization
      in
      the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
  <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature
      of
      the
      microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
  <p> “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
  <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
      Harvard
      supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them
      to
      the
      breakthrough.</p>
  <br>
  <h4 class="p-format"> A Special Time</h4>
  <br>
  <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late
      in
      his
      Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
      universe.
  </p>
  <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and
      strong
      and
      weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations
      of
      a
      single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
  <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
      mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
      force
      after another splitting away.</p>
  <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
  <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
      degrees,
      until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case,
      space
      itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
  <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
      universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
      space
      was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
  <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
      from
      a
      submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
      eye-blink.
  </p>
  <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All
      of
      normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky
      and
      stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free
      lunch,”
      Dr.
      Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
  <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
      vision
      suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
      comfortable
      homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
      endlessly,
      a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
  <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going
      any
      deeper into the past.</p>
  <p> We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
      erases
      everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
      away,
      forever out of our view.</p>
  <p> “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was
      not
      part
      of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
